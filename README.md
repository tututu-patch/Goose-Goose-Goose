Free open-source cheat software for **Goose Goose Duck**

** ONLY FOR WINDOWS!!!!!**

(Tested on windows 10, not tested in other Windows versions. But I think Windows 11 would work well.)

(I think it may be inefficient because I am not good at programming. If you think there's something to improve, please give me your active opinion.)


#### It doesn't matter if it's not fun, and it's made for those who want to win.
#### It is also made for personal study, and I am not responsible for any problems caused by using/abusing the project.
